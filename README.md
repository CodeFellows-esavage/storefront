This folder only contains the components required for your React Application.

1. Run `npx create-react-app storefront --use-npm` to create your react application.
1. `cd storefront` and replace the `src` folder generated by CRA with the `src` folder in this starter-code folder.
1. Run `npm start` to visually validate that your starter-code components are working properly.

## Usage

Will outline useful examples here.
